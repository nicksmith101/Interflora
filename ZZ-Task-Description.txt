Well done on impressing Interflora.

 

The task is to create a react app which handles the following:

    The user can write a short greeting
    After having written the greeting the user can do one of two things:
        Write a category in a separate field
        Select a matching category from a list of existing categories.

    The user should be able to save the text with the category and once its saves the combination should be visible in a list of saved combinations.
    The App should be styled according to Interfloraâ€™s brand.
    It must be responsive. 

Upload the task to github and send me the repo.
